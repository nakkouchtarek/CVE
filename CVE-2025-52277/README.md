### Summary
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in YesWiki v.4.54 allows a lower-privilege administrator to inject and execute malicious script content via the meta robots configuration field, affecting every page on the Wiki. This enables a lower-privileged administrator to escalate privileges by hijacking sessions and performing unauthorized actions on behalf of higher-privilege administrators and any other visitors to the wiki, severely impacting multi-administrator installations.

### Details
The tags meta configuration panel contains an input field for setting meta robots tag that does not properly sanitze user input. When an administrator enters Javascript code in there, it will get loaded in the meta field directly for any other session and thus impact any other user. 

### Steps to Reproduce

* Login as your admin account or a user that has read/write to meta tags


* Go to Gestion de site -> Fichier de conf -> Tags meta for web indexing


* In the meta[robots] field input the following payload: `"><script>alert(1)</script>`

* Submit and now when you visit any other page you'll get an alert

### Impact

This stored XSS vulnerability affects all users since it executes on every page a user visits through the meta tag. An attacker through it can hijack user sessions, perform unauthorized actions through malicious scripts, steal credentials, and compromise other administrator / user accounts to gain persistent access.
